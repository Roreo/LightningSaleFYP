# Lightning Sale
I created the Android app Lightning Sale as a part of my Final Year Project for my course Business Information Systems at University College Cork.


<h2>The Problem</h2>
As a confused shopper at the best of times I started to find it hard to know whether or not I was getting the best deal I could when shopping on the high street.

I was becoming flustered with the amount of different selection available when all I wanted was maybe to purchase one simple thing.

I thought if there was a quick and easy way to scan local shops and see what deals/offers/sales were available I would use it quite often.

Most shops still rely on window or storefront signage to attract customers in the nearby vacinity. This meant that for me to know about an ongoing sale I would have to either view it directly from the store's signage or else hear about it by chance through word of mouth etc...


<h2>The Solution</h2>

To create an app which allowed shopperes to quickly browse nearby sales tailored to their shopping preferences.

What the app does:
<ul>
  <li>Shop owners can register their shop through the website. From there they can create and monitor sales thorough the dashboard.</li>
  <li>These Lightning Sales can last a maximum of 24 hours and are restricted to a certain locale.</li>
  <li>Potential customers then download the app and select theirshopping preferences.</li>
  <li>Once their preferences are saved they can then tap the nearby NFC tag and a list with local sales in their preferences will be shown.</li>
  <li>Customers can then like these sales and sort through them in various ways, such as ending soonest, what's hot etc...</li>

</ul>

Future features:

<ul>
  <li>The addition of a Google sign-in option for the customers. This will give business owners more flexibility in how targeted they want their sales. Age, gender etc...</li>
  <li>The addition of iBeacons bluetooth technology to automatically populate the list when passing a nearby sale. Similar to Google's project The Physical Web.</li>
  <li>The addition of location based sales as an option for some customers.</li>
  <li>Tablet and smartwatch compatible.</li>
</ul>
